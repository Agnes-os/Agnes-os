Agnes is a toy operating system solution for experimenting with virtual machine targets where the operating system provides the machine to the processes instead of the hardware. This solution is nothing new, and has been used in a variety of ways include the IBM AS/400 models of computers from the 1980s. The goal is to create a virtual machine representing the Agnes architecture and memory layout. First, a base system with memory management and modular extension support (i.e. kernel modules), process images (ELF?) must be developed first.

This project is BSD 3-clause licensed. Bmake is used for the build syastem and fasmg (Flat Assembler g) is used for the assembly of machine-specific underlying hardware code for booting, etc. It is a goal to use fasmg's awesome macro features in order to create an assembler for the Agnes architecture as well, which will be a stack based architecture.
